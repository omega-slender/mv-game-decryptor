# MV Game Decryptor
**MV Game Decryptor** is a simple tool designed to decrypt games created with RPG Maker MV, enabling you to convert them into editable projects. This project is based on the work of Petschko and leverages Python along with several libraries to make this process possible.

## How to Use 🛠️
1. 📥 **Download** the source code or the Windows distribution version.  
2. 🔍 **Locate** the `www` folder of the game you want to decrypt.  
3. 🖱️ **Drag** the `www` folder or the `index.html` file onto one of the following:  
   - `MV_Game_Decryptor.py` (source code)
   - `MV Game Decryptor.exe` (Windows distribution)
4. ⏳ **Wait** for the process to complete.
5. 🎉 **Once completed**, a file named "Game.rpgproject" will be created in the `www` folder.
6. 🎮 **Open** the file with RPG Maker MV and edit it like a regular project.
